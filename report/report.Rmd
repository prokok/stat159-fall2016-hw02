#Abstract
  
In this report, I will reproduce the main results displayed in section 3.1 *Simple Linear Regression* (chapter3) of the book __An introduction to Statistical Learning.__



#Introduction 

The overall goal is to provide advice on how to improve sales of the particular product. More specifically,
the idea is to determine whether there is an association between TV advertising and sales, and if so, develop an accurate model that can be used to predict sales on the basis of the TV advertising budgets.  


#Data

The Advertising data set consists of the Sales (in thousands of units) of a particular product in 200 different markets, along with advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars) for the product in each of those markets for three different media: TV, Radio, and Newspaper.



#Methodology

We consider one media from the data set, TV, and study its relationship with Sales. For this purpose, we use
a simple linear model:  

$$\\Sales = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}TV$$ 

To estimate the coefficients $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$ we fit a regression model via the least squares criterion.



#Results

We compute the regression coefficients

```{r echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
load("../data/regression.Rdata")
sum_table = xtable(sum_reg$coefficient, caption="Information about Regression Coefficients")
print(sum_table, comment=FALSE, type = "latex")
```


-Under the null hyopthesis, p-value of intercept is significant to reject the null. The estimate of the intercept is `r sum_reg$coefficients[1,1]` with sd `r sum_reg$coefficients[1,2]`

-Under the null hyopthesis, p-value of slope is significant to reject the null. The estimate of the slope is `r sum_reg$coefficients[1,2]` with `r sum_reg$coefficients[2,2]`


More information about the least squares model is given in the table below:  


```{r echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
ind = data.frame(Quantity=c("R2","RSE","F-stat"), Value = c(sum_reg$r.squared,sum_reg$sigma,sum_reg$fstatistic[1]))
indice_table = xtable(ind, caption = "Regression Quality Indices")
print(indice_table, comment=FALSE, type="latex")
```
